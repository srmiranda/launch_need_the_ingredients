To accomplish this task, I took a look at the server.rb file.

I saw that the POST was targetting "/ingredients", so after some research
and talking to my fellow cohorts, I found out that "ingredients=" could
be the target of my curl post.

The syntax for the curl request was: curl -d "target for data" url

Which became: system("curl -d 'ingredient=#{item}' localhost:4567/ingredients")

I then wrapped my needed ingredients into an array and ran it through a .each
loop to add the proper variable to my curl post each time.
